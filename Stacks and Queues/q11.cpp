// Procedure for arithmetic expression evaluation: 
 
// 1. Convert the expression in Reverse Polish notation (post-fix notation). 
// 2. Push the operands into the stack in the order they appear.  
// 3. When any operator encounters then pop two topmost operands for executing the operation. 
// 4. After execution push the result obtained into the stack. 
// 5. After the complete execution of expression, the final result remains on the top of the stack.
