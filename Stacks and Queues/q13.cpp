// Since we can't use any data structure we will use reccursion stack to hold the elements
// Function defination :
// Base condition- if stack is empty push the element 
// store the top element, pop it, then reccurse for rest stack 
// now the element has been added (through recursion) so push the stored topmost element back to the stack
