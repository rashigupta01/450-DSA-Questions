// Approach 1: insert one tree nodes into another

// Approach 2: find inorder traversal of both the trees then use merge function of merge sort
// then convert it into a bst
// If we have to merge without creating new nodes, node pointers can be stored in inorder vectors
// code similar to done in q10
